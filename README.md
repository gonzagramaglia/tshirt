## Hey, I'm **[gonza](https://www.gonza.gr/)**
It's good to see that you have been interested in understanding this repository.<br><br>



I want to thank JavaScript Mastery ([jmastery.pro](https://www.jsmastery.pro/)) 
who was my guide in the development adventure of this project, 
during the **[Build and Deploy an AI-Powered 3D Website Using React](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqEa8fTxypQ)** tutorial ðŸ’Ž<br><br><br>



ðŸ“Œ **LIVE DEMO [UNDER CONSTRUCTION]: _https://product.gonza.gr/_**

[![Product Demo Preview](https://i.postimg.cc/3JCZXcrT/under-construction.png)](https://i.postimg.cc/3JCZXcrT/under-construction.png)

#### Product folder
Create project folder, open it in VSCode and open terminal

#### Project Setup:
```bash
npm create vite@latest -- --template react client
```
```bash
cd client
```

#### Installing one of the best CSS frameworks (and its peer dependencies):
```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```
(the -D flag in Tailwind CSS enables development mode, providing additional utility classes and features during compilation. It enhances the development process but should be avoided in production builds to keep the final CSS file optimized)
